# Summary {#sec-summary .title}

## Data Analytics & Consulting

Dynamic and growth-oriented Data Scientist with a background in Manufacturing Engineering and Supply Chain Analytics, I specialize in driving data-centric solutions and innovative projects across diverse industries. Starting with foundational skills in Python and SQL, I quickly became an expert in R, mastering it in real-world scenarios. My role has expanded to being the tech lead for multiple clients, running end-to-end data projects and presenting their results.

## Key Contributions

-   **Data Management & Visualization:** Developed robust data infrastructures using self-hosted [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and implemented efficient ETL processes with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) & the [{tidyverse}](https://www.tidyverse.org/) family of packages, significantly enhancing data accessibility and manipulation. Expert in building insightful Tableau dashboards and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)/[RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) reports tailored to client needs.

-   **Advanced Analytics:** Adopted cutting-edge tools like [Helium10](https://www.helium10.com/), [Scrapfly](https://scrapfly.io/), & [Oxylabs](https://oxylabs.io/) for sophisticated web scraping, and extracting valuable data from platforms like Amazon and Walmart to inform strategic decisions.

-   **Software Improvement:** Adopt the use of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), & [GitHub](https://github.com/), and designed a custom {ggplot2} add-on aligning with company guidelines.

In my previous roles, I led substantial Continuous Improvement initiatives, generating savings of \$1-3 million by optimizing processes on the manufacturing floor. I spearheaded quality control standardization across North American facilities and contributed to inventory management through a bespoke recommendation engine. My technical toolkit expanded during this time to include CAD for designing new machinery layouts and developing ad-hoc dashboards for strategic oversight. My analytical journey is underpinned by a strong educational foundation, including a role as a Teaching Assistant during my undergraduate studies, where I honed my skills in teaching and academic leadership.

## Core Competencies

**Analytics**: R (Tidyverse), SQL (PostgreSQL, DuckDB), Git & GitHub, Excel

**Communication**: Quarto, ggplot2, gt, shiny, HTML & SCSS/CSS
