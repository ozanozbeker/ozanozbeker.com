I wanted to practice this textbook to better my knowledge of {ggplot2}, but also get a feel for the design behind the package, [*The Grammar of Graphics*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28695-0).\n\n*\"Without a grammar, there is no underlying theory, so most graphics packages are a big collection of special cases.\"*\n\nI will not be re-iterating all of the information from the book, but running through the Exercises at the end of the chapters. Follow along to see my take on the exercises, as well as my notes and thoughts as I progress through the book.\n\n**Required Packages**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(c(\n  \"colorBlindness\", \"directlabels\", \"dplyr\", \"ggforce\", \"gghighlight\", \"ggnewscale\",\n  \"ggplot2\", \"ggraph\", \"ggtext\", \"ggthemes\", \"hexbin\", \"Hmisc\", \"mapproj\", \"maps\",\n  \"munsell\", \"ozmaps\", \"paletteer\", \"patchwork\", \"rmapshaper\", \"scico\", \"seriation\",\n  \"sf\", \"stars\", \"tidygraph\", \"tidyr\", \"wesanderson\"\n))\n```\n:::\n",
