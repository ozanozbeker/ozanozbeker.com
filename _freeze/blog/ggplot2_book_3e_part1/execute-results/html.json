I wanted to practice this textbook to better my knowledge of {ggplot2}, but also get a feel for the design behind the package, [*The Grammar of Graphics*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28695-0).\n\n> *\"Without a grammar, there is no underlying theory, so most graphics packages are a big collection of special cases.\"*\n\nI will not be re-iterating all of the information from the book, but provide a brief summary of each section and run through the exercises. Follow along to see my take on the exercises, as well as my notes and thoughts as I progress through the book.\n\nIf you would like to see the source code behind this post, you can click on the **Code** button at the top of right of the page, sandwiched between the title of the post and the side panel.\n\nThe book is split into five parts: *Getting Started*, *Layers*, *Scales*, *The Grammar*, & *Advanced Topics*. In this post, I will be working through the first part, *Getting Started*.\n\n::: callout-important\nIt wasn't until I was mostly done with this post that I realized that this 3rd Edition is still under development. I do plan on finishing this series, but I might wait until the book is complete before moving on from this first part.\n:::\n\n## Required Packages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(c(\n  \"colorBlindness\", \"directlabels\", \"dplyr\", \"ggforce\", \"gghighlight\",\n  \"ggnewscale\", \"ggplot2\", \"ggraph\", \"ggtext\", \"ggthemes\", \"hexbin\", \"Hmisc\", \n  \"mapproj\", \"maps\", \"munsell\", \"ozmaps\", \"paletteer\", \"patchwork\", \"rmapshaper\",\n  \"scico\", \"seriation\", \"sf\", \"stars\", \"tidygraph\", \"tidyr\", \"wesanderson\"\n))\n```\n:::\n\n\n# First Steps\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe goal of this chapter it so introduce the reader to {ggplot2} as quickly as possible. Because it's an intro, I will not be formatting the plots any further than the questions ask for.\n\n## Fuel Economy Data\n\nIn this chapter, we will be using mostly one data set, `mpg`, from <http://fueleconomy.gov>. It holds information about the fuel economy of popular car models in 1999 & 2009.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) # Data Wrangling, includes {ggplot2}\n\nmpg\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 234 × 11\n   manufacturer model      displ  year   cyl trans drv     cty   hwy fl    class\n   <chr>        <chr>      <dbl> <int> <int> <chr> <chr> <int> <int> <chr> <chr>\n 1 audi         a4           1.8  1999     4 auto… f        18    29 p     comp…\n 2 audi         a4           1.8  1999     4 manu… f        21    29 p     comp…\n 3 audi         a4           2    2008     4 manu… f        20    31 p     comp…\n 4 audi         a4           2    2008     4 auto… f        21    30 p     comp…\n 5 audi         a4           2.8  1999     6 auto… f        16    26 p     comp…\n 6 audi         a4           2.8  1999     6 manu… f        18    26 p     comp…\n 7 audi         a4           3.1  2008     6 auto… f        18    27 p     comp…\n 8 audi         a4 quattro   1.8  1999     4 manu… 4        18    26 p     comp…\n 9 audi         a4 quattro   1.8  1999     4 auto… 4        16    25 p     comp…\n10 audi         a4 quattro   2    2008     4 manu… 4        20    28 p     comp…\n# ℹ 224 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA quick overview of the variables:\n\n-   `cty` and `hwy` record miles per gallon (mpg) for city and highway driving.\n-   `displ` is the engine displacement in liters.\n-   `drv` is the drivetrain: front wheel (f), rear wheel (r), or four wheel.\n-   `model` is the model of car.

A set of **aesthetic mappings** between variables in the data and visual properties, and\n3.  At least one layer which describes how to render each observation. Layers are usually created with a **geom** function.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.3 Example-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Exercises\n\n[1. How would you describe the relationship between `cty` and `hwy`? Do you have any concerns about drawing conclusions from that plot?]{.blog-question}\n\nThere is a strong positive linear relationship between city & highway gas mileage. Just plotting only those two might generalize too much across different classes of vehicles. Even though it may be true, maybe different classes of vehicles are more equal in city vs highway gas mileage vs performing substantially better in one or the other.\n\n[2.

As with regular R code, Warnings show where the code can still run but probably with not the effect that was intended, where Errors are impossible to process and the code does not run.\n\n[3. How is drive train related to fuel economy? How is drive train related to engine size and class?]{.blog-question}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"1\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(drv, hwy)) + geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.4 Q3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, class, color = drv)) + geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.4 Q3-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFront-wheel transmission vehicle seems to have the best highway gas mileage, where 4-wheel and rear-wheel show similar performance to each other.\n\nAlmost all 4-wheel drive vehicles (in this dataset) are either an SUV or Pickup, and have the biggest range in engine size. The smallest vehicles (2-seater & subcompact) have bigger engines and are rear-wheel drive, probably sports cars of some sort. Finally, the regular everyday vehicles like compact & midsize cars have smaller engines and mostly front-wheel drive transmissions.\n\n## Faceting\n\nFaceting creates tables of graphics by splitting the data into subsets and displaying the same graph for each subset. The two type so faceting are **grid** and **wrapped**.

A line plot is constrained to produce lines that travel from left to right, while paths can go in any direction. Lines are typically used to explore how things change over time.\n\n### Adding a smoother to a plot\n\nIf you have a scatterplot with a lot of noise, it can be hard to see the dominant pattern. In this case, it's useful to add a smoothed line to the plot with `geom_smooth()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.1 Example geom_smooth()-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAn important argument to `geom_smooth()` is the `method`, which allows you to choose which type of model is used to fit the smooth curve:\n\n-   `method = \"loess\"`, the default for small n, uses a smooth local regression. `\"span\"` controls the level of smoothing.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"1\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(span = 0.2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.1 Example geom_smooth() with span-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(span = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.1 Example geom_smooth() with span-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   `method = \"gam\"` fits a generalized additive model provided by the {mgcv} package.
