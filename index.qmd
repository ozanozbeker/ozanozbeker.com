**As a Data Scientist**, I specialize in leveraging advanced analytics to tackle complex business challenges. With a solid foundation in Python and SQL, I've quickly mastered R and become a key player in my current role, managing significant client projects. My expertise includes developing and maintaining robust data infrastructures with PostgreSQL and enhancing data workflows through efficient ETL processes using R and the Tidyverse. I also have a keen interest in web scraping, utilizing state-of-the-art tools like Helium10, Scrapfly, and Oxylabs to extract actionable insights from major online marketplaces.

**Outside of work**, I'm a huge fan of live music, especially Rock and EDM, and I'm making a bigger effort to travel and create experiences this year. I've been playing the guitar for about 10 years and creating a budget for around 3 years. When the weather's nice, I enjoy cycling, hiking, and taking photos. Recently, I've developed a keen interest in learning more about the R language outside of my direct work, inspired by the fantastic blogs I've come across, which led me to create this website.

**On this site**, you'll find my resume, personal projects, and a blog where I dive deep into various tools and technologies in the data world, along with other topics I find interesting. Feel free to reach out and connect!
