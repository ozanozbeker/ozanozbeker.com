As a Data Scientist, I specialize in leveraging advanced analytics to solve complex business challenges. With a solid foundation in Python and SQL, I quickly excelled in R, becoming a key player in my current role where I manage significant client projects. My expertise extends to developing and maintaining robust data infrastructures using PostgreSQL and enhancing data workflows with efficient ETL processes using R and the Tidyverse. I have a keen interest in web scraping, utilizing state-of-the-art tools like Helium10, Scrapfly, and Oxylabs to extract actionable insights from major online marketplaces.

As a human, I'm a huge fan of live music (especially metalcore/emd) and am making a bigger effort to travel and create experiences this year. I've been playing the guitar for \~10 years and creating a budget for \~3 years. When the weather permits, I like to cycle and/or hike, try to touch some grass, and take some nice photos. One of the many perks of living in Almost Heaven, West Virginia! Out of my other hobbies, I have gotten an interest to learn more about the R language outside my direct work and have really enjoyed others' blogs, which is what inspired to make this website.

In this website, you can find my resume, personal projects, and a blog featuring my deep dives in to tools and technologies in the data world, as well as other things I find interesting. Feel free to reach out and connect!
